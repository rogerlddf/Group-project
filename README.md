# AteBall 


### What is AteBall?

AteBall helps you answer the most important question.... **"Where do you want to eat"**

### What does AteBall do? 

In the simplest terms, AteBall generates a random restaurant when you *shake* the ball, and then gives you information about the restaurant. 

### Who is AteBall for? 

Everyone at one point in there life has not known where to eat or they don't care enough to pick a place. 
Basically, AteBall is for anyone and everyone that is hungry, indecisive, or both.

### How does it work? 

#### Starting Steps: 
1. First type in your zipcode. **This is required** 
2. Add you have the option to add filters like: 
    * Mile radius 
    * Price range
    * Star Rating
3. If you don't have any preferences then press **submit**!

Once you are done will all of that, the magic AteBall will display a modal with the the random restaurant. The modal will show:

    - The restaurant name
    - The address 
    - Star rating
    - Price range
    - If you would like to be redirected to the website or the yelp page
    - And if you would like to be redirected to open table to make a reservation (if the restaurant offers that option.)

If you are not satisfied with the random restaurant, you can *shake* again to get a new one.
